          The Taj Mahal is a stunning white marble mausoleum in Agra, India,
          built in the 17th century by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. It is
          widely regarded as one of the world's most beautiful buildings and is
          celebrated for its architectural brilliance, intricate craftsmanship,
          and symbolic significance. Shah Jahan commissioned the Taj Mahal in
          memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died during childbirth
          in 1631. Construction began in 1632 and was largely completed by 1643,
          although additional elements continued for a few more years.

          its outstanding architectural beauty and historical significance.
          UNESCO recognized the Taj Mahal as a masterpiece that represents
          Mughal architecture at its height, blending Persian, Indian, and
          Islamic influences with remarkable craftsmanship.
